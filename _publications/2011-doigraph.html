Partial graph visualizations, sometimes also referred to as online graph
visualizations, are visual representations of graphs that show only connections
around a particular point of interest. They are often a useful, less complex
alternative to visual representations of graphs as a whole or can serve as
visualizations when the whole data is not accessible at once. Their biggest
downside is that users quickly lose orientation because they never get a sense
of the structure of the whole graph. In this paper, we introduce techniques that
improve user exploration of partial graphs by integrating both browsing and
querying information finding paradigms. From a given partial graph, users can
specify queries relevant to user tasks and the results will be displayed as
visual aids that helps users navigate representations of graphs with a limited
look-ahead. Much like signposts in the physical world, these graphcues highlight
the shortest path to relevant nodes from the user's current location in the
graph. We demonstrate these concepts on a social network of approximately
500,000 people and 30 million relationships.
