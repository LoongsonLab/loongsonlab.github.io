We aim to increase the flexibility at which a data worker can choose the right
tool for the job, regardless of whether the tool is a code library or an
interactive graphical user interface (GUI). To achieve this flexibility, we
extend computational notebooks with a new API mage, which supports tools that
can represent themselves as both code and GUI as needed. We dis- cuss the design
of mage as well as design opportunities in the space of flexible code/GUI tools
for data work. To understand tooling needs, we conduct a study with nine
professional practitioners and elicit their feedback on mage and potential areas
for flexible code/GUI tooling. We then implement six client tools for mage that
illustrate the main themes of our study findings. Finally, we discuss open
challenges in providing flexible code/GUI interactions for data workers.
