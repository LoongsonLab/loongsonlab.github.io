Mark LoMBardI waS perhapS the perFeCt Network Layout aLgorIthM. As an artist
intent on communicating complex networks of financial and political scandals, he
diligently drew networks where nodes never overlap, edges rarely cross, and the
connections are smooth and curvy. This amount of grace and sensitivity is rarely
present in the visualizations of social networks created by computational means.
While advanced computational layout algorithms may be grounded in physical
models of springs and forces, they rarely highlight patterns and trends like
Lombardi's drawings do. This chapter details my attempts to empower users to dig
deeper into these chaotic social network visualizations with interactive
techniques that integrate visualization and statistics.
