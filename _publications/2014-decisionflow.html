Patients' medical conditions often evolve in complex and seemingly unpredictable
ways. Even within a relatively narrow and well-defined episode of care,
variations between patients in both their progression and eventual outcome can
be dramatic. Understanding the patterns of events observed within a popula- tion
that most correlate with differences in outcome is therefore an important task
in many types of stud- ies using retrospective electronic health data. In this
paper, we present a method for interactive pattern mining and analysis that
supports ad hoc visual exploration of patterns mined from retrospective clinical
patient data. Our approach combines (1) visual query capabilities to
interactively specify episode defini- tions, (2) pattern mining techniques to
help discover important intermediate events within an episode, and (3)
interactive visualization techniques that help uncover event patterns that most
impact outcome and how those associations change over time. In addition to
presenting our methodology, we describe a prototype implementation and present
use cases highlighting the types of insights or hypotheses that our approach can
help uncover.
