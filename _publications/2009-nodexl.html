We present NodeXL, an extendible toolkit for network overview, discovery and
exploration implemented as an add-in to the Microsoft Excel 2007 spreadsheet
software. We demonstrate NodeXL data analysis and visualization features with a
social media data sample drawn from an enterprise intranet social network. A
sequence of NodeXL operations from data import to computation of network
statistics and refinement of network visualization through sorting, filtering,
and clustering functions is described. These operations reveal sociologically
relevant differences in the patterns of interconnection among employee
participants in the social media space. The tool and method can be broadly
applied.
