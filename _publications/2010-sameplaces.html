In this work we examine nine different sources for user similarity as reflected
by activity in social media applications. We suggest a classification of these
sources into three categories: people, things, and places. Lists of similar
people returned by the nine sources are found to be highly different from each
other as well as from the list of people the user is familiar with, suggesting
that aggregation of sources may be valuable. Evaluation of the sources and their
aggregates points at their usefulness across different scenarios, such as
information discovery and expertise location, and also highlights sources and
aggregates that are particularly valuable for inferring user similarity.
