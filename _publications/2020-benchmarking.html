In this paper, we present a new benchmark to validate the suitability of
database systems for interactive visualization workloads. While there exist
proposals for evaluating database systems on interactive data exploration
workloads, none rely on real user traces for database benchmarking. To this end,
our long term goal is to collect user traces that represent workloads with
different exploration characteristics. In this paper, we present an initial
benchmark that focuses on "crossfilter"-style applications, which are a popular
interaction type for data exploration and a particularly demanding scenario for
testing database system performance. We make our benchmark materials, including
input datasets, interaction sequences, corresponding SQL queries, and analysis
code, freely available as a community resource, to foster further research in
this area: <a href="https://osf.io/9xerb/">osf.io/9xerb</a>.
