Recent studies on people recommendation have focused on suggesting people the
user already knows. In this work, we use social media behavioral data to
recommend people the user is not likely to know, but nonetheless may be
interested in. Our evaluation is based on an extensive user study with 516
participants within a large enterprise and includes both quantitative and
qualitative results. We found that many employees valued the recommendations,
even if only one or two of nine recommendations were interesting strangers.
Based on these results, we discuss potential deployment routes and design
implications for a stranger recommendation feature.
