Facebook and Twitter have changed the way we consume information, allowing the
people we follow to become our "social filters" and determine the content of our
information stream. The capability to discover the individuals a user is most
interested in following has therefore become an important aspect of the struggle
against information overflow. We argue that the people users are most interested
in following are not necessarily those with whom they are most familiar. We
compare these two types of social relationships – interest and familiarity –
inside IBM. We suggest inferring interest relationships from users' public
interactions on four enterprise social media applications. We study these
interest relationships through an offline analysis as well as an extensive user
study, in which we combine people-based and content-based evaluations. The paper
reports a rich set of results, comparing various sources for implicit interest
indications; distinguishing between content-related activities and status or
network updates, showing that the former are of more interest; and highlighting
that the interest relationships include very interesting individuals that are
not among the most familiar ones, and can therefore play an important role in
social stream filtering, especially for content-related activities.
