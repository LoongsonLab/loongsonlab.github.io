There is a growing body of research into the adoption and use of social software
in enterprises. However, less is known about how groups, such as communities,
use and appropriate these technologies, and the implications for community
structures. In a study of 188 very active online enterprise communities, we
found systematic differences in size, demographics and participation, aligned
with differences in community types. Different types of communities differed in
their appropriation of social software tools to create and use shared resources,
and build relationships. We propose implications for design of community support
features, services for potential community members, and organizations looking to
derive value from online groups.
