In this demonstration, we will showcase Myria, our novel cloud service for big
data management and analytics designed to improve productivity. Myria's goal is
for users to simply upload their data and for the system to help them be
self-sufficient data science experts on their data â€“ self-serve analytics. From
a web browser, Myria users can upload data, author efficient queries to process
and explore the data, and debug correctness and performance issues. Myria
queries are executed on a scalable, parallel cluster that uses both state-of-
the-art and novel methods for distributed query processing. Our interactive
demonstration will guide visitors through an exploration of several key Myria
features by interfacing with the live system to analyze big datasets over the
web.
