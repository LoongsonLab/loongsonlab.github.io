The amount of generated and analyzed data is ever increasing, and processing
such large data sets can take too long in situations where time-to-decision or
fluid data exploration are critical. Progressive visual analytics (PVA) has
recently emerged as a potential solution that allows users to analyze
intermediary results during the computation without waiting for the computation
to complete. However, there has been limited consideration on how these
techniques impact the user. Based on discussions from a Dagstuhl seminar held in
October 2018, this paper characterizes PVA users by their common roles, their
main tasks, and their distinct focus of analysis. It further discusses cognitive
biases that play a particular role in PVA. This work will help PVA visualization
designers in devising systems that are tailored for their specific target users
and their characteristics.
