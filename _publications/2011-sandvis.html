As people continue to author and share increasing amounts of information in
social media, the opportunity to leverage such information for relationship
discovery tasks increases. In this paper, we describe a set of systems that
mine, aggregate, and infer a social graph from social media inside an
enterprise, resulting in over 73 million relationships between 450,000 people.
We then describe SaNDVis, a novel visual analytics tool that supports
people-centric tasks like expertise location, team building, and team
coordination in the enterprise. We also provide details of a 12-month-long,
large-scale deployment to almost 1,800 users from which we extract dominant use
cases from log and interview data. By integrating social position, evidence, and
facets into SaNDVis, we demonstrate how users can use a visual analytics tool to
reflect on existing relationships as well as build new relationships in an
enterprise setting.
