  Objective: To develop a visual analytic system to help medical professionals
  improve disease diagnosis by providing insights for understanding disease
  progression.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
  Methods: We develop MatrixFlow, a visual analytic system that takes clinical
  event sequences of patients as input, constructs time-evolving networks and
  visualizes them as a temporal flow of matrices. MatrixFlow provides several
  interactive features for analysis: 1) one can sort the events based on the
  similarity in order to accentuate underlying cluster patterns among those
  events; 2) one can compare co-occurrence events over time and across cohorts
  through additional line graph visualization.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
  Results: MatrixFlow is applied to visualize heart failure (HF) symptom events
  extracted from a large cohort of HF cases and controls (n=50,625), which
  allows medical experts to reach insights involving temporal patterns and
  clusters of interest, and compare cohorts in novel ways that may lead to
  improved disease diagnoses.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
  Conclusions: MatrixFlow is an interactive visual analytic system that allows
  users to quickly discover patterns in clinical event sequences. By unearthing
  the patterns hidden within and displaying them to medical experts, users
  become empowered to make decisions influenced by historical patterns.
