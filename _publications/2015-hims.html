The concept of Learning Health Systems(LHS) is gaining momentum as more and more
electronic healthcare data becomes increasingly accessible. The core idea is to
enable learning from the collective experience of a care delivery network as
recorded in the observational data, to iteratively improve care quality as care
is being provided in a real world setting. In line with this vision, much recent
research effort has been devoted to exploring machine learning, data mining and
data visualization methodologies that can be used to derive real world evidence
from diverse sources of healthcare data to provide personalized decision support
for care delivery and care management. In this chapter, we will give an overview
of a wide range of analytics and visualization components we have developed,
examples of clinical insights reached from these components, and some new
directions we are taking.
