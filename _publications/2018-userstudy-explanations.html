Recently, there is growing consensus of the critical need to have better
techniques to explain machine learning models. However, many of the popular
techniques are instance-level explanations, which ex- plain the model from the
point of view of a single data point. While local explanations may be
misleading, they are also not human-scale, as it is impossible for users to read
explanations for how the model behaves on all of their data points. Our
work-in-progress paper explores the effectiveness of providing instance-level
explanations in aggregate, by demonstrating that such aggregated explanations
have a significant impact on users' ability to detect biases in data. This is
achieved by comparing meaningful subsets, such as differences between ground
truth labels, predicted labels, and correct and incorrect predictions, which
provide necessary navigation to explain machine learning models.
