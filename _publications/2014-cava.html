Cohort analysis is a widely used technique for the investigation of risk factors
for groups of people. It is commonly employed to gain insights about interesting
subsets of a population in fields such as medicine, bioinformatics, and social
science. The nature of these analyses is evolving as larger collections of data
about individuals become available. Examples of emerging large-scale data
sources include electronic medical record systems and social network datasets.
When domain experts perform cohort analyses using such massive datasets, they
typically rely on a team of technologists to help manage and process the data.
This results in a slow and cumbersome analysis process in which iterative
exploration is difficult. To address this challenge, we are exploring
technologies designed to help domain experts work more independently and more
quickly. This article describes CAVA, a platform for Cohort Analysis via Visual
Analytics. We introduce three primary types of artifacts (cohorts, views, and
analytics) and an architecture that connects these elements together to provide
an interactive exploratory analysis environment designed for domain experts. In
addition to the CAVA design, this article presents two use cases from the
health-care domain and a domain-expert evaluation to demonstrate the power of
our approach.
