This is the first article in the lab, as is traditional: **Hello World!**

The lab website could not have been created without the efforts of everyone in the lab.
Thanks to [Benyi Xie]({{ 'people/xiebenyi' | relative_url }}) for registering the `github` organization account;
Thanks to the lab assistant and manager for helping with the ID photos;
Thank you to [Dongru Zhao]({{ 'people/zhaodongru' | relative_url }}) for 'PS' the ID photos for everyone.

Finally, hope the lab will get better.

Cheers~
